# TGK 2.0 — Canonical State Matrix

**Audit date:** 2026-05-07 (wrap state for handoff to Steven & Jesse)
**Purpose:** One source of truth for what each vertical *is* today vs. what
the docs and older memories *say* it is. Drives the prioritized build
punch list at the bottom.

This file gets edited as work lands. Don't trust REGISTRY.md or
VERTICAL_PORTALS.md alone — they were brought current 2026-04-26 AM but
the vertical-count split happened later that day; spot-check before
quoting either as authoritative on count.

**For team navigation:** start with `HANDOFF.md` for the lego framework
TL;DR + day-1 file map. This doc is the granular state, not the intro.

## Wrap state (2026-05-07)

Patrick's last day of active development is 2026-05-06. Steven & Jesse
take over the codebase 2026-05-07 with target of IAM for Sales by next
Friday. This section captures everything that landed during the wrap
that overrides earlier sections of this doc.

### Evening of 2026-05-07 — what shipped after the morning handoff

Patrick stayed at the keyboard one more session and landed five things:

1. **Studio pipeline (`/studio.html` + `builder/`)** — new 5-stage
   MP4-to-animated-HTML pipeline (Decode → Triage → Classify → Extract →
   Render). Wired end-to-end with Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash; runs in fake
   mode without `GEMINI_API_KEY` so the team can click through every
   screen pre-integration. Verbatim prompts at `builder/prompts/v1/`,
   server routes mounted at `/api/builder/jobs/*`. **Different output
   type than flipbooks** — produces re-skinnable animated DOM-replay
   HTML with verticalization via `content.json` + `theme.json` edits.
   Hand-off state documented in `builder/README.md`.

2. **Search vignettes** — `flipbooks/Search_Agent.html` (356 frames) and
   `flipbooks/Search_Demo.html` (246 frames). MP4 sources staged at
   `flipbooks/vids/` (gitignored). Auto-registered in
   `flipbooks/manifest.json` (now 17 cards) so they appear in the
   builder media pool on next deploy.

3. **Solution design doc** — `docs/solution-design.html`. Single 44KB
   self-contained reference page for the team: interactive lego schema,
   60-cell canonical grid visualization, surfaces map, decision log
   (17 entries), roadmap pulled from commits + builder/README. Linked
   from main README.

4. **Picker function-first revert + thinning + Headless IAM 5th cells**
   — see "Picker — function-first restored + thinned" subsection below.

5. **Repo reorg complete** — 16 files moved out of root in two
   phases this evening. Phase 1: 5 docs to `docs/` (STORYLINES,
   _cleanup_candidates, "HLS Discovery Playbook…", "Public Sector",
   TGK-2.0-Imagery-Spec) + 2 scratch HTMLs to `docs/experiments/`
   (HANDOFF.html, _persona-keyboard-demo.html). Phase 2: 9 root HTMLs
   to `docs/experiments/` (architecture, audit-dashboard, dashboard,
   landing, index-playbook, auto, composition-stack, geos,
   index-unified). All inbound references updated in picker.html,
   server.js, admin/index.html, audit/SKILL.md, and the spec docs.
   Server.js preserves friendly aliases (`/architecture` →
   `/docs/experiments/architecture.html`) so existing deep-links
   keep resolving.

### 5-demos-per-sub-vertical (locked 2026-05-06)

Every sub-vertical now exposes **exactly 5 demos** — Onboarding,
Maintenance, Fraud Fabric, Headless IAM, Workspaces — across 4 clusters
(FINS, HLS, PubSec, Cross-org). 60-cell canonical grid total. The 11
earlier "split-out" verticals (insurance-life, insurance-pc,
banking-deposits, wealth-discovery, provider-roi, slgov-{311,benefits,
recertification,vendor-compliance,employee-onboarding,licensing}) are
NO longer first-class picker entries — they live as the **content** of
specific cells in the canonical grid (e.g. `insurance-life` is the
content for *FINS · Insurance · Maintenance*; `slgov-recertification`
is *PubSec · SLGov · Maintenance*). URL deep-links to the split-out
keys keep working as aliases — they just don't surface in `picker.html`.

Mapping doc: `_audits/sub-vertical-mapping.md` — full grid with
which-key-fills-which-cell + 17 cells flagged as "(needs build)".

### Picker — function-first restored + thinned (2026-05-07 evening)

`picker.html` was briefly rebuilt 2026-05-06 as a 4-cluster × 3-sub × 5-demo
grid (Cluster → Sub-vertical → Demo). Reverted 2026-05-07 evening to the
**function-first** structure:

- **Step 1**: 3 function cards — Procurement, Sales, Customer Experience.
- **Step 2 (Procurement / Sales)**: per-function use-case lists, branching
  directly from step 1.
- **Step 2 (Customer Experience)**: inline CX wizard with Demo Story /
  Discovery toggle, then vertical (FS / HLS / PubSec) → sub-vertical →
  step 3 demos.
- **Step 3**: Catalog data thinned to **exactly 1 demo per (sub-vertical ×
  category)** per `_audits/sub-vertical-mapping.md` canonical mapping.
  Every sub-vertical now exposes 5 cells: Onboarding, Maintenance, Fraud
  Fabric, Headless IAM, Workspaces (with two cells flagged as build-queue:
  HLS Provider Maintenance, PubSec SLGov Maintenance).

Step 3 went from 89 entries (with split-out duplicates rendered as separate
cards) → 38 thinned cells → 48 with the Headless IAM 5th cells added.

URL deep-link aliases for the dropped split-out keys (`?vertical=
wealth-discovery`, `banking-deposits`, `insurance-life/pc`, `provider-roi`,
`slgov-{311,benefits,recertification,vendor-compliance,employee-onboarding,
licensing}`) still resolve via `story-shell.html` VERTICALS map — only the
picker UI surfacing changed.

### Narration sweep — concise + impactful (2026-05-06)

All 23 VERTICALS-map entries' orientation ledes collapsed from 2
paragraphs to 1-2 sentences; every beat lede tightened to subject +
verb + period-break (per Jimmy: "for longer ones, shorten to just the
short bars"). Cadence reference: Scene 5 Beat 5 of wealth ("Every
document executed, every check passed, every party in the same
Workspace. Hillside's compliance team has the full audit trail.").
Zero multi-paragraph ledes remain in the VERTICALS map.

The `tgk-usecases` JSON sidecar still holds older usecase-variant
copy (maintenance / fraud-fabric / intake / workspaces) — that fires
only when `?usecase=` is set on the URL. Canonical default flow is
fully concise.

### New audit-grid surface (2026-05-06)

`/audit-grid.html` — sortable + filterable + inline-edit grid of every
(vertical, scene, beat) tuple in the VERTICALS map. ~575 rows.
Edits POST to `/api/builder/save-beat` which writes to
`/stories/_shared/vertical-overrides.json`; the shell merges
overrides over canonical at boot. Replaces the per-beat inspector view
on `/audit.html` (which is still around as "Classic dashboard").

### Builder ("Demo iMovie") finalized — Stage 4 + admin gate (2026-05-06)

`/builder.html` now has 4 stages:

  1. Sequence — pick a starting flow (or blank)
  2. Brand the demo — tenant + customer + color + logos + SoR + Sig Moment
  3. Scenes — drag-drop scene composer with media pool (canonical
     templates + flipbook vignettes from `/flipbooks/manifest.json`)
  4. Admin tools — gated by `Welcome01!` via `/assets/admin-auth/`.
     Four cards: A) MP4 → flipbook vignette pipeline, B) Edit baked-in
     beat narration (writes `vertical-overrides.json`), C) Browse +
     replace existing vignettes, D) Edit current/future state HTML.

Step 2 captures both **tenant logo** (Hillside, Meridian, etc.) AND a
new **customer logo** (TGK Capital, Atlas Manufacturing). Both ride
through to `cfg.tenantLogo` / `cfg.customerLogo` and render in the
shell topbar lockup. System of Record + Signature Moment are real
persisted fields. Generated demo URL is real
(`/stories/custom-<token>/`) — the route in `server.js` line 1448
serves the cfg-injected shell.

### Admin auth (2026-05-06)

Single password gate `Welcome01!` for all `/admin/*` routes + builder
Stage 4 + audit-grid inline edits. Primitive at
`/assets/admin-auth/{admin-auth.css, admin-auth.js}` exposes
`AdminAuth.isUnlocked() / .prompt() / .lock()`. SessionStorage-backed,
sets `x-tgk-admin` cookie on unlock; `requireAdmin` and
`requireBuilderAdmin` middleware in `server.js` validate the cookie.

### TGK Capital co-brand removed from chrome (2026-05-06)

TGK Capital is now a **character inside** wealth + banking storylines
(the firm being onboarded / the borrower), NOT a chrome co-brand.
`.cobrand-x` and `.cobrand-tgk` CSS + DOM stripped from
`story-shell.html`. Topbar is Docusign-only. Patrick Meyer / TGK
Capital references inside narration text are preserved.

### Persona handoff model — autoplay-only (2026-05-06)

Replaces the earlier "click to hand off to next actor" gesture-pause
pattern. At persona crossings, the shell sidebar fires a 360ms violet
sweep + headline flash and autoplay continues. The
`<div class="persona-handoff">` cue + `.is-handoff-pending` avatar
glow are retired. Same-persona beats stay flat.

### Speed baseline retuned (2026-05-06)

`SPEED_MULTIPLIER = 1.75` constant in `story-shell.html`. Displayed
rates stay 1× / 1.5× / 2× in the hint row but effective rates are
1.75× / 2.625× / 3.5× of the canonical scene durations. Cold-open
default playbackRate dropped from 1.5 to 1 since the baseline is now
faster.

### Sub-Advisory Agreement → IMA fix (2026-05-06)

The wealth storyline reads as "Sub-Advisory Agreement" everywhere now.
Earlier hardcoded "Investment Advisory Agreement" references in
`docusign-signing-ceremony.html` (s2/s3/s4 env-titles + h4 headings +
body paragraph) and the `webform-intake.html` wealth onboarding preset
(was Aster Capital / Mira Sundar / IMA cast) are templated through
`p.envTitle` and rewritten to TGK Capital × Hillside.

### Sidebar layout — spatial balance (2026-05-06)

Auto margins on step-label (top) and lede (bottom) split free space
between persona card and beat pips, floating the narration block to
vertical center. Foot-spacer downgraded to flex:0. Headline 22→19px,
line-height 1.22→1.3; lede font 13.5→13px, line-height 1.6→1.5.

### Per-beat field-fill replays (2026-05-06)

Every wealth scene has on-state-entry interactions that read as
cursor-driven:

  Scene 1 (webform-intake): dropdown reset → engagement chip flips →
    checkboxes tick in sequence → name/email/phone fill in waves
  Scene 2 (clear-idv): I Agree button pulse · option tile bounce ·
    phone digits 212-641-5393 type-fills in chunks
  Scene 3 (signing): REVIEW DOCUMENT pulse · START tab pulse ·
    Adopt+Sign pulse · finished routing pulse
  Scene 4 (navigator): agreement_row pulse · ai_banner pulse ·
    fields_panel pulse · iris_answer pulse
  Scene 5 (workspace): access_workspace · tabs_strip · iris_rail ·
    agent_status · agent_summary pulses

Single `.just-pulsed` keyframe across templates: 0.55s cubic spring,
6px violet glow, 1.02 scale.

### Scene 5 splash — pause + Spacebar (2026-05-06)

Workspaces splash (the MasterCard-style intro) no longer auto-fades
after 10 seconds. Stays up indefinitely with "Press Space when ready"
hint at the bottom. Iframe ↔ shell handshake via postMessage:
`tgk:splashShown` / `tgk:dismissSplash` / `tgk:splashDismissed`. On
Space, splash fades, autoplay resumes.

### Other surfaces

- **SoR badge** — `System of record: <vendor>` pill in the chrome of
  every scene template. Mapping at `_audits/sor-mapping.md`. Wired via
  `/assets/sor-badge/{sor-badge.css, sor-badge.js}`.
- **Navigator per-doc** — every preset now carries its own document
  content (docTitle / docHeading / docBody / docFields). No generic
  Master Services Agreement fallback.
- **Workspace cast** — wealth preset rewritten from Amy Peters / Casey
  Anderson to Patrick Meyer / Cathie Woods.
- **Discovery side-by-side bug** — `width: 100%` added to `.state-grid`
  across 13 Discovery files; steps 2+ now render both panels.
- **Demo-stage primitive** for sales/procurement flipbooks
  (`/assets/demo-stage/`) carries the same keyboard model + toast
  + speed-cycle as the shell.

---

## Hosting & deploy

Two targets, one source. Source files use root-relative paths (`/assets/…`,
`/docs/experiments/index-unified.html`, `/api/feedback`). **Do not** convert source paths to
relative — both targets depend on the absolute form, and the Pages workflow
adds the prefix automatically.

- **Replit (`server.js` + Express):** the live working environment. Serves
  source files unchanged at the domain root. Backend routes (`/api/feedback`,
  `/admin/*`, SSE) only work here. This is where feedback collection runs.
- **GitHub Pages (`jnimbles03.github.io/tgk-2.0/`):** static-only mirror.
  Auto-deploys on push to `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`,
  which copies the repo into `_site/`, runs `.github/scripts/rewrite-paths.mjs`
  (prepends `/tgk-2.0/` to all root-relative paths), swaps the legacy
  `index.html` to `story-demo-classic.html`, and writes a fresh redirect
  `index.html` → `docs/experiments/index-unified.html`. The feedback widget no-ops here
  (POST 404s silently). Admin console partially renders but its API calls
  404 — this is intentional while feedback is being phased out.

One-time repo setup: **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.

## Canonical shape (locked 2026-04-26)

One demo experience per vertical, one technology shape across all
verticals:

- **Entry point:** `/stories/story-<vertical>/index.html` is a thin
  redirect to `/stories/_shared/story-shell.html?vertical=<key>`.
- **Shell:** a single ~1,058-line `story-shell.html` reads `?vertical=`
  and renders a **5-scene narration** with shared hotspot coordinates
  pointing at Docusign template UI elements.
- **Scene template loading order is fixed and shared across all
  verticals:**

  | Scene | Role | Template iframe loaded | Hotspot key |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Sender | `docusign-agreement-desk.html?preset=<vertical>` | `agreement_desk` |
  | 2 | Identity | `docusign-clear-idv.html?preset=<vertical>` | `clear_idv` |
  | 3 | Signing | `docusign-signing-ceremony.html?preset=<vertical>` | `signing` |
  | 4 | Data | `docusign-navigator.html?preset=<vertical>` | `navigator` |
  | 5 | Workspace | `docusign-workspace.html?preset=<vertical>[&splash=1]` | `workspace` |

- **`?splash=1`** appended to any vertical URL bolts the MasterCard-style
  Workspace splash onto Scene 5. The splash is no longer MasterCard-only;
  it's a Workspace-intro pattern any vertical can opt into.
- **Hotspots are shared across verticals** because they target Docusign
  template UI, which doesn't shift per preset. Only narration (sidebar
  copy + per-beat headlines) varies by vertical.

### Five-flow taxonomy (locked 2026-04-28)

Every vertical exposes four story flavors via `?usecase=` plus a
core-vertical-level Headless IAM page:

| Flow | URL | Scenes | Narration source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Onboarding** | `?vertical=<key>` (no usecase) | 5 | `v.scenes` (canonical) |
| **Maintenance** | `?vertical=<key>&usecase=maintenance` | 3 | `v.usecases.maintenance.scenes` (inlined) |
| **Fraud Fabric** | `?vertical=<key>&usecase=fraud-fabric` | 3 | `v.usecases.fraud-fabric.scenes` (inlined) |
| **Workspaces** | `?vertical=<key>&usecase=workspaces` | 1 | synthesized from `v.scenes[4]` (canonical Scene 5) |
| **Headless** | `/headless-iam/{fins,hls,ps}.html` | n/a | tenant-branded portal |

Backward compat: `?usecase=auth-fabric` aliases silently to `fraud-fabric`
(rename happened 2026-04-28; alias to be dropped after ~6 months).

Use-case narration is inlined in story-shell.html as
`<script id="tgk-usecases" type="application/json">` (eliminates the
network fetch and the load flash). The async fetch path is retained as a
fallback only.

This shape supersedes the older recipe.json + per-portal scene HTMLs
architecture described in VERTICAL_PORTALS.md and the
`stories/wealth-onboarding-v2/` multi-tenant pattern in REGISTRY.md.

---

## Vertical matrix

**Twenty-one verticals** registered in the shell's `VERTICALS` map as of
2026-04-26 PM (was 10 at the start of the day). The new 11 came from the
"split into their own" decision — provider/insurance got dedicated
verticals for their distinct stories, the 6 public-sector samplers each
became their own vertical, and the remaining 2 split-eligible samplers
(banking-deposits, wealth-onboarding) added two more. Plus a vanity
portal folder (`wealth-hillside-aster`) redirecting to `?vertical=wealth`.

The original 10 stay unchanged. The 11 new entries:

| New vertical | Tenant + named customer | Mark color | **Splash default** | Source sampler |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `insurance-life` | Beacon Mutual × Whitfield Family — death claim | `#B189D9` | **✓** | `insurance-life.html` |
| `insurance-pc` | Northgate Mutual × Patel Logistics — commercial auto FNOL | `#FF8A4D` | **✓** | `insurance-pc.html` |
| `provider-roi` | Catalina Medical × Eric Tan — records release to Silver Mountain Disability | `#5BCDB8` | ✗ | `hls-roi.html` |
| `slgov-311` | Greenhaven Public Works × 1124 Cedar Ave pothole | `#4CAF7A` | ✗ | `public-sector-311.html` |
| `slgov-benefits` | Eastside HHS × Rivera family SNAP application | `#5DA9C9` | **✓** | `public-sector-benefits.html` |
| `slgov-recertification` | Cascade Medicaid × Diane Park annual recert | `#94A3B8` | ✗ | `public-sector-recertification.html` |
| `slgov-vendor-compliance` | Ridgeview Procurement × Apex Logistics annual COI | `#E89B5B` | ✗ | `public-sector-vendor-compliance.html` |
| `slgov-employee-onboarding` | Cascade County HR × Marcus Lee new caseworker | `#B589DB` | ✗ | `public-sector-employee-onboarding.html` |
| `slgov-licensing` | Northbrook Licensing Bureau × Avalon Café restaurant license | `#F2A56B` | ✗ | `public-sector-licensing.html` |
| `banking-deposits` | Cedar Federal Credit Union × Williams household — Account Opening (A-trig). `?usecase=fraud-fabric` = high-value wire + chain-of-custody. `?usecase=maintenance` = household beneficiary update (B). | `#6BB6FF` | ✗ | `banking-deposits.html` |
| `wealth-discovery` | Cypress Wealth × Holcomb Family — IRA rollover + family trust | `#5BA1B8` | **✓** | `wealth-onboarding.html` |

Each new vertical has the same shape as the original 10:
- Full shell `VERTICALS` entry: 5 scenes × 5 beats × tenant + customer narrative
- Matching workspace `PRESETS` entry: tenant + email + summary + sections + activity + Iris + agent
- Redirect at `/stories/story-<key>/index.html`
- Splash works via `?splash=1` (now that the splash is inlined). **As of 2026-04-27,
  splash is also enabled by default on 8 verticals via the `splashOk:true` flag in
  the shell's `VERTICALS` map — see "Splash default" column below.** `?splash=0`
  forces it off; `?splash=1` forces it on; no param uses the per-vertical default.

**Original 10 verticals** (unchanged):

Truth-test legend: ✓ wired · ◐ partial · ✗ missing · — not applicable.

| Vertical key | Tenant + named customer | Mark color | All 5 scenes wired | Preset exists | `?splash=1` works | **Splash default** | Root sampler | Sampler decision | Future-state components |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wealth` | Hillside × Aster Capital — New Client Onboarding | `#3FDA99` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** | `wealth-onboarding.html` | fold or retire | ~6 (`wealth-onboarding`) |
| `banking` | Meridian × Atlas Manufacturing — $2.5M Working Capital Facility | `#2D8EFF` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** | `banking-deposits.html` | fold or retire | ~6 (`retail-banking-deposits`) |
| `insurance` | Sentinel × Ramirez Family — HO3 Policy Binding | `#F2B3C2` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | `insurance-life.html`, `insurance-pc.html` | shell covers HO3; samplers are L&A and P&C niches | many (`insurance-life-annuities-*` + `insurance-pc-*`) |
| `provider` | Riverside × Jordan Kim — New Patient Onboarding | `#6FD6C8` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | `hls-discovery-process-map.html`, `hls-roi.html` | hls-roi is a distinct ROI flow, may earn its own preset | ~10 (`hls`, `hls-roi`) |
| `lifesciences` | Helix × Austin Research Clinic — Site Activation for HX-2104 | `#C7A0FF` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** | none | — | 0 dedicated; ad-hoc demos only |
| `payor` | Unity × Marcus Chen — Silver HMO Enrollment | `#6FDA9B` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | none | — | 0 dedicated |
| `fedgov` | DOL × Taylor Nguyen — UI Claim UI-2026-48211 | `#E8B800` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | `public-sector-employee-onboarding.html`, `public-sector-recertification.html` | overlap with slgov; re-bucket | shared with slgov |
| `slgov` | Springfield × 1420 Oak Street — Residential Building Permit | `#E8A438` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | `public-sector-311.html`, `-benefits`, `-licensing`, `-vendor-compliance` (+ shared with fedgov) | shell covers permit; the 6 samplers are 6 distinct slgov flavors | many (`public-sector-*` × 6 sub-scopes) |
| `education` | Maple Ridge × Priya Shah — Fall 2026 Student Onboarding | `#F2C65A` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | none | — | 0 dedicated |
| `nonprofit` | Harbor × Safe Streets Initiative — $120k Grantee Onboarding | `#FFB86B` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** | none | — | 0 dedicated |

**Headline read:** narration is fully populated for **all 21 verticals** — 5
scenes × 5 beats each, with tenant brand, named customer, and color
applied. All 19 also have matching presets in
`story-templates/docusign-workspace.html` (which carries 27 presets
total once you count the older sub-presets like `wealth-hnw-onboarding`,
`banking-commercial-loan-mod`, `lifesciences-mlr-review`, etc.). The
shell is shippable for every one of them.

~~**Verified bug:** `?splash=1` is currently a no-op for **every** vertical.~~
**Resolved 2026-04-26.** Splash CSS + JS inlined inside
`docusign-workspace.html` (`.mc-splash` block in `<style>`, `loadSplash`
IIFE at the end of the script block). The previous external load of
`/stories/_shared/mastercard-splash.{css,js}` is gone — those files
never existed on disk. `?splash=1` now triggers a ~10s
Deep-Violet-on-Ecru splash (brand lockup → 3 editorial lines → preset-
specific descriptor tag → fade-out) before the Workspace appears.

---

## ~~Architectural drift to reconcile~~ — Resolved 2026-04-26

All three doc-drift items below were addressed in the same pass that
inlined the splash. Notes preserved for historical traceability.

1. ~~**`VERTICAL_PORTALS.md`** still describes the 4-scene spine with `recipe.json`.~~
   Updated. The "How the portals fit into TGK story structure",
   "Story shells on disk", "Authoring order", and "Next build priorities"
   sections were rewritten to describe the 5-scene shell + `VERTICALS` map +
   `?vertical=` redirect pattern. A new "How to add or edit a vertical"
   section now points authors at the shell. The architecture-note callout
   at the top of the doc explicitly flags the body capability palettes
   as the spec, not the delivery mechanism.

2. ~~**`REGISTRY.md`** says component-level mocks number 89+.~~ Updated to
   97 current-state and 100 future-state. The wealth-onboarding-v2
   multi-tenant pattern section was reframed as "deprecated — superseded
   by `?vertical=` + per-vertical preset." The chrome-alignment table
   referencing dead folders (payor-healthedge, federal-servicenow,
   insurance-la-duckcreek) was replaced with a brief historical note.
   The Maestro template's "84 of 95 future-state components" claim was
   updated to "88 of 100 as of 2026-04-26."

3. ~~**`mastercard-splash.css/.js` shared module**~~ — never existed.
   Replaced everywhere: REGISTRY's Workspaces template section now points
   at the inlined splash, VERTICAL_PORTALS's MasterCard scene-block was
   rewritten, and the comment header inside `docusign-workspace.html` was
   updated to describe the inline implementation.

## Root-level samplers

Twelve sampler HTMLs at the project root. As of 2026-04-26 PM (final pass),
**11 of the 12 have been converted to thin redirects** pointing to their
matching shell verticals. The original sampler content is preserved in git
history. The 12th (`hls-discovery-process-map.html`) stays as-is — it's a
process-map artifact, not a story arc. Updated per-sampler decisions:

| Sampler | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `insurance-life.html` | ✓ Redirects to `insurance-life` vertical | Original in git history |
| `insurance-pc.html` | ✓ Redirects to `insurance-pc` vertical | Original in git history |
| `hls-roi.html` | ✓ Redirects to `provider-roi` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-311.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-311` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-benefits.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-benefits` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-recertification.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-recertification` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-vendor-compliance.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-vendor-compliance` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-employee-onboarding.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-employee-onboarding` vertical | Original in git history |
| `public-sector-licensing.html` | ✓ Redirects to `slgov-licensing` vertical | Original in git history |
| `banking-deposits.html` | ✓ Redirects to `banking-deposits` vertical | Original in git history |
| `wealth-onboarding.html` | ✓ Redirects to `wealth-discovery` vertical | Original in git history |
| `hls-discovery-process-map.html` | Standalone artifact (preserved) | Process map view, not a story arc — keep as-is |

**Resolved 2026-04-26 PM.** The "split into their own" decision was made
explicit: each distinct story gets its own first-class vertical entry in
the shell, not a sub-preset. Result: 9 new verticals authored from the 9
superseded samplers. The `?subv=` proposal was not needed; the shell
handles each story as a peer entry under `VERTICALS`.

The 3 remaining samplers (`banking-deposits.html`, `wealth-onboarding.html`,
`hls-discovery-process-map.html`) didn't get split this round and need
separate disposition.

## Future-state coverage (rough)

Rough counts by scope suffix in `/components/future-state/` (100 files

The shell's Scene 4 (Navigator) doesn't currently surface these
component mocks — the iframe loads `docusign-navigator.html` directly.
**Question to resolve:** are future-state components meant to be
Navigator surface variants, or do they live in the root samplers as
the destination of Scene 3 drill-downs?

## Build punch list (prioritized)

In dependency order. Don't skip ahead — each step de-risks the next.

### P-new — Document Intelligence story (added 2026-06-11)

The builder's new **Out of the Box guided mode** (`builder.html`, mode
toggle in the topbar; `?mode=ootb` deep-link) offers a 4th archetype,
**Document Intelligence**, currently wired to `?usecase=intake` as a
stand-in. Per Jimmy: build a dedicated Navigator / agreement-AI story
(extraction, obligations, repository intelligence) and swap the
`docintel` URLs in builder.html's `OOTB_MAP` when it lands. Agentic
source material: `story-templates/docusign-agents.html` + the 4
"Docusign Agentic Experiences" component demos.

### ~~P0 — lock the canonical shape in docs~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-26

1. ~~Rewrite `VERTICAL_PORTALS.md` "Story shells on disk" + "Authoring order".~~ ✓
2. ~~Update `REGISTRY.md` component count + prune stale sections.~~ ✓
3. ~~Decide: keep or delete `mastercard-workspace.html`.~~ ✓ Already a thin redirect.

### ~~P1 — fix the broken splash + verify shell rendering~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-26

4. ~~Fix `?splash=1`.~~ ✓ Inlined inside `docusign-workspace.html`.
5. ~~Spot-load each of the 10 verticals.~~ ✓ Verified via Read/Grep — all 11 portal redirects use the correct vertical key, all 10 keys exist in shell `VERTICALS`, all 10 keys exist in workspace `PRESETS`. No live browser check yet — recommend a quick eyeballing on Replit before P2 begins.

### ~~P2 — sampler reconciliation~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-26 PM

6. ~~Add `?subv=<key>` to the shell.~~ Not needed — went with first-class verticals instead.
7. ~~Decide each sampler's fate.~~ ✓ 11 of 12 samplers now have a matching shell vertical; 12th (process-map artifact) preserved as-is.
8. ~~Retire or redirect samplers.~~ ✓ All 11 superseded samplers now redirect to their canonical shell URLs. Originals preserved in git history.

### ~~P2.5 — handle the remaining 3 samplers~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-26 PM (final pass)

8a. ~~`banking-deposits.html`~~ ✓ Authored `banking-deposits` vertical (Cedar Federal × Williams household joint checking). Sampler now redirects.
8b. ~~`wealth-onboarding.html`~~ ✓ Authored `wealth-discovery` vertical (Cypress Wealth × Holcomb Family multi-account onboarding). Sampler now redirects.
8c. ~~`hls-discovery-process-map.html`~~ ✓ Confirmed as standalone process-map artifact. Preserved as-is.

### P3 — coverage matrix and SoR badge sweep (≤ 4 hours)

9. **Wire future-state components into Navigator surfaces.** The
   ~100 future-state files belong somewhere — the most natural slot
   is as Scene 3 (Signing) or Scene 4 (Data) drill-downs. Pick one
   vertical, prove the wiring, then sweep.
10. **Apply the SoR badge treatment** ("System of record" pill in
    chrome) across all 5 scene templates per vertical, mapping the
    correct vendor per the REGISTRY badge kit table.
11. **Re-run `tgk-audit`** across the shell + scene templates after
    everything above lands.

### P4 — story polish

12. Visual polish, hotspot calibration with the shell's calibrate mode,
    SoR-per-vertical brand application, copy review.

## Picker consolidation — geos × index-unified

**Decision (2026-04-29):** the surviving picker will be a **new
consolidated file** (name TBD; provisionally `/picker.html` or a
rebuilt `/index.html`), not a takeover of either existing file. Both
`docs/experiments/geos.html` (function-first) and `docs/experiments/index-unified.html` (vertical-first)
become redirects once the new file ships. The FINS/HLS/PS path uses
**inline cluster cards + handoff to a vertical chooser** — the b2c
wizard isn't being inlined into geos's existing flow; the new picker
will host both halves cleanly.

### Wizard primitive — extracted 2026-04-29

`/assets/wizard/wizard.css` and `/assets/wizard/wizard.js` now own the
generic wizard pattern:

- **wizard.css** — `.wizard-back` button visuals + the "show back
  button on stages 2–6" rule. Page-specific show/hide rules
  (`#subverticalSection` etc.) stay in the consumer page because
  they're tied to the page's DOM.
- **wizard.js** — exposes `window.WizardPrimitive` with `setStage(n)`,
  `getStage()`, and `attachBack({ btnSelector, onBack, escapeGuard })`.
  Pages keep their own state-clearing handler inside `onBack`.

**DOM contract:** `<body>` accepts `wizard-mode` + `wizard-stage-{N}`
classes. Page supplies a back button (default selector `#wizardBack`)
and per-stage CSS show/hide rules.

### Status

- ✓ Wizard primitive extracted to `/assets/wizard/`.
- ✓ `docs/experiments/index-unified.html` consumes the primitive — its local
  `setWizardStage` is now a thin wrapper around `WizardPrimitive.setStage`,
  and its back-button + Escape wiring is one `attachBack` call. Behavior
  unchanged.
- ✓ `docs/experiments/geos.html` loads `wizard.css` + `wizard.js` for forward-compat. It
  doesn't add `wizard-mode` to body today (still uses `.locked` section
  unlocking), so zero behavior change; assets are pre-positioned for the
  consolidated file.
- ✓ Built `picker.html` — function-first (Procurement / Sales / CX) with CX expanding inline to the full vertical wizard (no navigate-away).
- ✓ `server.js` `/` route + Pages deploy redirect flipped to `picker.html`.
- ✓ `docs/experiments/geos.html` and `docs/experiments/index-unified.html` converted to thin JS redirects (forward `?cluster=` / `?mode=` intact).

### Visual + structural state of the two pages

- Hero / STEP-1 layout is already aligned between geos and unified
  (cross-reference comments inside each file confirm — "matching the
  equivalent compression on geos.html", "Aligned to .option-card in
  index-unified.html").
- geos handles Procurement + Sales itself (linking to flipbook
  demo-stage pages) and hands the b2c path off to index-unified via
  `?cluster=fins|hls|ps`. index-unified honors the cluster param and
  pre-selects the matching vertical (see `CLUSTER_TO_VERTICAL` in its
  IIFE).
- Routing today: `server.js` redirects `/` → `/docs/experiments/index-unified.html`;
  the Pages workflow's generated `index.html` also redirects to
  `/docs/experiments/index-unified.html`. geos.html is reachable only by direct URL.

## Callable vignettes

Vignettes are reusable Docusign UI moments that any vertical can iframe
into any beat. Unlike scene templates (which are slotted at fixed
positions in the 5-scene spine), vignettes are operator-driven — narration
JSON references them per-beat as drill-downs or scene replacements.

| Vignette | File | URL params | First-wired verticals |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Connected Forms** (Maestro · Add Connected Forms wizard + App Center · Field Mapping) | `/story-templates/docusign-connected-forms.html` | `?embed=1` (hide chrome) · `?view=maestro\|appcenter` · `?preset=wealth\|wealth-discovery\|insurance\|insurance-life\|insurance-pc\|generic` · `?step=1\|2\|3\|done` | wealth, wealth-discovery, insurance, insurance-life, insurance-pc |
| **Contract Hierarchy** (agreement repository · party page → Define/Add/Relate wizard → two-level tree → share with access levels; ~48s loop modeled on the CY25.Q4 product design export at repo root) | `/story-templates/docusign-hierarchy.html` | `?embed=1` (flat, no caption) · `?preset=banking-ma\|generic` · `?scene=party\|hier-empty\|wiz-define\|wiz-add\|wiz-relate\|detail\|share` · `?hold=1` (freeze scene) · `?interactive=1` | banking (two-bank M&A lens), procurement; details in `story-templates/REGISTRY.md` §8 |

### Connected Forms — calling pattern

```html
<!-- As a Scene 1 / Scene 4 drill-down, embedded in a beat: -->
<iframe src="/story-templates/docusign-connected-forms.html?embed=1&preset=wealth&view=maestro&step=2"></iframe>
```

The shell can also drive it post-mount via postMessage:

```js
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ type: "tgk:lockToBeat", view: "appcenter", step: "done" }, "*");
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ type: "tgk:setPreset", preset: "insurance-life" }, "*");
```

Hotspot anchors inside the vignette (queryable via `tgk:queryRect`):
`cf_node`, `cf_step1`, `cf_step2`, `cf_step3`, `cf_field_mapping`.

### Why this lives outside the 5-scene spine

The 5-scene spine (Agreement Desk · CLEAR · Signing · Navigator ·
Workspace) is locked. Connected Forms isn't a sixth scene — it's a
configuration moment that sits inside Maestro (visualized as Scene 1's
Agreement Desk) and inside App Center (a Docusign admin surface, not
part of any one scene). Treating it as a callable vignette lets:

- wealth and insurance verticals use it as a Scene 1 drill-down
  ("Priya's onboarding workflow includes a Connected Forms step"),
- any vertical reference it from Scene 4 narration as a "where the
  forms came from" admin tour,
- new vignettes be added later without changing the spine.

### How to add a new vignette

1. Drop the template in `/story-templates/docusign-<name>.html`.
2. Support `?embed=1` (hide outer chrome) + `?preset=` (per-vertical
   defaults) + the postMessage protocol used by the shell
   (`tgk:lockToBeat`, `tgk:queryRect`, replying with `tgk:rect`).
3. Tag interactive sub-elements with `data-hotspot="<name>"` so the
   shell's calibrator can pin shell-level hotspots to them.
4. Register the row in the table above + bump
   `REGISTRY.md` "Story-level templates" count.

## Open questions that need a human decision

The next session blocks on these. Each shapes how P2 (sampler
reconciliation) gets executed.

- **Sub-flows:** add `?subv=` to the shell, or keep samplers as Scene 3
  drill-downs? (Recommended: add `subv` — one shell, parameter-driven,
  no per-tenant HTML duplication. Same lesson the wealth-onboarding-v2
  experiment delivered before it was deprecated.)
- **Provider has two distinct stories** (new patient onboarding in shell,
  ROI in sampler). Sub-preset, or break out as a new vertical?
- **Insurance has three stories** (HO3 binding in shell, L&A new-business
  in `insurance-life`, P&C in `insurance-pc`). Same question.
- **Are future-state components meant to surface inside Navigator/Workspace
  templates, or only as drill-downs from samplers?** This determines
  whether P3 step 9 wires components into iframe templates or into
  Scene 3 drill-down panels.
